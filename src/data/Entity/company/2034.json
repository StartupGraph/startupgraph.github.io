Craigslist was founded by [Craig Newmark](/person/craig-newmark) in March, 1995, as an email list site for [San Francisco](/maps/city/San%2520Francisco) and  Bay Area events.  In June 2000, it added its second city, [Boston](/maps/search?range=10&geo=boston), and then expanded to the major metropolitan cities in August 2000.  As of February 2008, Craiglist now covers 450 in 50 US States and 50 Countries.\nCraiglist.org -- note the .org domain suffix -- is interesting in that it serves no ads and stresses a non-corporate culture.
