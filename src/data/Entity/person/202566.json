One of my greatest joys at Google was helping product folks on my team at Google be entrepreneurial and now I do the same for high caliber entrepreneurs outside of Google.\nI launched the AdSense for Content business in 2003 and grew it to a multibillion dollar product line growing into a role managing 20+ product managers. I worked in the Google Apps group (2008-2010) focused on Google's photo products (Picasa, PicasaWeb, Google+, etc). I authored over a dozen patents, championed acquisitions of Applied Semantics, Feedburner, Picnik, and Performics and served as the product lead for the $3B DoubleClick integration.\nPrior to joining Google, I founded Zaplet (now MetricStream), a Kleiner Perkins, Vinod Khosla start-up bringing email based applications to market. I led product management for GolfWeb (now the golf section of CBS Sports), and previously held product positions at HP, and IBM. I hold a B.S. from UCLA and a M.S. from Stanford.\nSpecialties:Bringing innovative new products to market.Starting technology companies.","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null}
