It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks.\nThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\nWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook.\nWith millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address.\nIn the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006.\nNot long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\nFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).\nOne sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/).\nNotwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\nFacebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"Menlo Park","investment_rounds":3,"invested_companies":3,"funding_rounds":11,"funding_total_usd":2425700000}

Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture.\nMySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004.\nBy February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through.\nAfter being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010.\nIn mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean.\nIn late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace.\nIn mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price.\nSince 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people.\nIn June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"Beverly Hills","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":null,"funding_total_usd":null}

Users enter a song or artist that they enjoy, and the service responds by playing selections that are musically similar. Users provide feedback on approval or disapproval of individual songs, which Pandora takes into account for future selections.\nWhile listening, users are offered the ability to buy the songs or albums at various online retailers. As part of the Music Genome Project, over 400 different musical attributes are considered when selecting the next song. These 400 attributes are combined into larger groups called focus traits. There are 2,000 focus traits. Examples of these are rhythm syncopation, key tonality, vocal harmonies, and displayed instrumental proficiency.\nThe Music Genome Project is what powers Pandora's personalization, as it is a detailed, hand-built musical taxonomy. Using this musicological “DNA” and constant listener feedback Pandora crafts personalized stations from the more than 800,000 songs that have been analyzed since the project began in January 2000. More than 75 million people throughout the United States listen to personalized radio stations for free on Pandora through their PCs, mobile phones and devices such as the iPad, and connected in-house devices ranging from TVs to set-top boxes to Blu-Ray players.\nMobile technology has been a significant factor in the growth and popularity of Pandora, starting with the introduction of the Apple app store for the iPhone in the Summer of 2008. Pandora instantly became one of the most top downloaded apps and today, according to Nielsen, is one of the top five most popular apps across all smart-phone platforms. Pandora is mostly free and, thanks to connectivity, available everywhere consumers are – at the office, at home, in the car and all points in between.\nIn 2009 the Company announced that Pandora would be incorporated into the dashboard in Ford cars via SYNC technology; GM has already followed in announcing plans to integrate Pandora into its vehicles’ OnStar system. Since more than 50% of radio listening happens in the car, this was a crucial arena for Pandora.\nAlso in 2009, Pandora announced that an agreement had been reached regarding the royalty issue, which would significantly reduce the royalty rate, making it possible for Pandora to stay in business. It announced, too, that free listening would be limited to 40 hours per month but can be extended to unlimited for that month for $0.99. \"The revised royalties are quite high,\" the company's blog notes, \"higher in fact than any other form of radio.\" The extended listening fee differs from \"upgrading,\" which also disables advertisements, increases the bitrate to 192 kbps, and provides a dedicated music player (as opposed to listening through browser). This service, known as \"Pandora One\", costs $36 and is billed annually.\nDue to copyright and licensing rulings, Pandora is only available in the United States, but Pandora has said that it has plans to extend its service to a global market.","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"Oakland","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":5,"funding_total_usd":56300000}

Developers write primarily in the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java libraries.\nThe unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code under the Apache License, a free software and open source license.\nThe Android open-source software stack consists of Java applications running on a Java-based, object-oriented application framework on top of Java core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework, SQLite relational database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating system, including the Linux kernel, consists of roughly 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of XML, 2.8 million lines of C, 2.1 million lines of Java, and 1.75 million lines of C++.","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"Palo Alto","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":null,"funding_total_usd":null}

Major acquisitions include the purchase of technology news blog TechCrunch in September 2010, and on March 7, 2011, the purchase of The Huffington Post.
