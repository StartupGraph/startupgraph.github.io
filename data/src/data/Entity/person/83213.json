He experienced his first thrills of code magically compiling at the age of 14 and has been hooked on technology ever since. Armed with a B.Sc. and a M.Eng. from MIT and Bay Area software experience from VMware, Vontu, and Symantec, he is now excited to have joined the ccLoop team as a director of engineering and founding employee.\nWhen not plugged into the digital collective, Oskar can be found either traveling, roaming California's back-country roads on his motorcycle, or nurturing his artistic needs in his darkroom, engulfed in red light and chemical fumes.","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null}
