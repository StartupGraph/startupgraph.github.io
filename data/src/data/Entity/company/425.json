Frustrated by working from multiple computers, Drew was inspired to create a service that would let people bring all their files anywhere, with no need to email around attachments. Drew created a demo of Dropbox and showed it to fellow MIT student Arash Ferdowsi, who dropped out with only one semester left to help make Dropbox a reality. Guiding their decisions was a relentless focus on crafting a simple and reliable experience across every computer and phone.\nDrew and Arash moved to San Francisco in fall 2007, secured seed funding from Y Combinator, and set about building a world-class engineering team. In fall 2008, Sequoia Capital led a $7.2M Series A with Accel Partners to help bring Dropbox to people everywhere.","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"San Francisco","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":4,"funding_total_usd":257200000}
