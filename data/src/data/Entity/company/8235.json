This is unusual, because most SaaS helpdesk solutions focus exclusively on the backend helpdesk and treat the Web as an afterthought.\nThe system also leverages Web 2.0 ideas on the backend, such as tag based categorization throughout instead of the usual pre-defined drop down lists, RSS feeds for every customized view and a complete REST/JSON API for virtually every entity in the system.\n","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"San Francisco","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":5,"funding_total_usd":85500000}
