The application is compatible with iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch or Android devices running Android.\nIn an homage to both the Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid cameras, Instagram confines photos into a square shape. This is in contrast to the 3:2 aspect ratio normally used by the iOS device cameras.\nThe application was developed by [Kevin Systrom](/person/kevin-systrom) and [Mike Krieger](/person/mike-krieger).\nIn April 2012, Instagram was acquired by [Facebook](/company/facebook).","country_code":"USA","state_code":"CA","city":"San Francisco","investment_rounds":null,"invested_companies":null,"funding_rounds":3,"funding_total_usd":57500000}
